# Tic-Tac-Toe Demo Repository

This is a demonstration repository where our goal is to create an interactive tic-tac-toe game using SvelteKit. The application will be a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to play tic-tac-toe against a computer opponent.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a showcase for modern web development practices using SvelteKit to build a classic game with a clean, responsive interface and intelligent AI opponent.

## Design Documentation

For detailed information about the application architecture, component structure, and implementation plan, please see:

**ðŸ“‹ [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)** - Comprehensive design document outlining the SvelteKit-based tic-tac-toe application structure.

## Goals

- Create an engaging, accessible tic-tac-toe game
- Demonstrate SvelteKit capabilities for SPA development
- Implement clean, maintainable code architecture
- Provide responsive design for all device types
- Include AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels

## Getting Started

_Implementation coming soon - this repository currently contains the design documentation for the planned tic-tac-toe application._
